      <p>Nostalgic memories of mine popped up and brought me back to the contemplation of Betty Boop’s symbolism. What does it mean to reappropriate her image today? How did the reproduction of the golden era cartoon derive from an institutionalized, patriarchal interpretation of times and its people, to eventually be re-interpreted by individuals to correspond to other times and people? </p>
      <p>
        The symbolic character is a case study that illustrates a broader fascinating topic: the realm of the body of women as a weapon for the expression of our independence. As a collectible object too, its value confesses a fetishist fantasy.
         </p>
      <p>There’s a funny image of my childhood. I must be 7 years old. I look like a tomboy. Short hair, <em>not so girly</em> jacket and I’m holding that plastic submachine gun. On the wall behind hang some children’s drawings.
        I still feel very close to the young girl I perceive in this picture; I’ve pretty much always had a rebellious spirit showing through the way I perform, expressed through my clothes, through the music and the people that turned me on.
      </p>
      <p>She became an infinitely reproduced symbol of femininity. I aim to
        explore her representation used in high and low culture, by
        professionals and amateurs. I hope to find new ways to re-interpret her
        cult from a contemporary perspective, and what it would mean to
        re-contextualize her figure once more. I want to give a new stage to her
        story.</p>
      <p>To do so I elucidate the events that led to her fame, and their
        historical context. Later I question their significance for the
        participation in its image. I delved online communities like fan blogs
        that unveil the most concealed of Betty’s secrets, as well as various
        extensive image banks. While watching the very firsts Boop movies, I let
        myself experience how these archival materials reflect.</p>
      <p>Beside my writing, I contribute, in various methods, and demand other
        people to contribute to the reinterpretation of her image.</p>
      <p>My relation to BB’s image today is partly shaped by my graphic
        design/art studies. And my position as a white heterosexual female, born
        in 2000, determines my understanding of the story.</p>
      <p>I have discovered precious facts that concern the <em>Behind the
          Scenes</em> of Betty’s creation. And I am pleased to share them, in my
        own way.</p>
      <div class="indroduction" >
        <h1 id="introduction" class="title-style">Introduction </h1>
        <p>To assume popular culutre is the same for <em>everyone</em> is a
          misconception, what we consider universal in European societies are not
          always crossing borders.</p>
        <p>For the people who are not familiar with Betty Boop: It’s an early cartoon female character created in the late 20’s by
          Fleisher Studio in New York. Her appearance on screens did not
          continually persist. Nonetheless, today, almost a century after its
          debut in cinema, her face still carries on new adventures.</p>
        <p>The representation of its image resurfaced in contemporary setups,
          but much more as a merch or a reference magnified by a nostalgic
          embellishment of the past. Her destiny is no more in Fleishers’s hands,
          henceforth anyone can (un)dress her the way they like. Through editing,
          people participate in updating her portrayal to our times.</p>
        <p>Her destiny followed this path naturally with the existence of images
          in contemporary times. To pursue her authentic mindset, she had to
          become cocky and glittered.</p>

      Her</h1>
    <h2 id="our-first-encounters" class="title-style2">Our First Encounters</h2>
    <p>As a European young girl born in 2000, I always felt the need to
      blend my femininity with my masculinity. One day I liked to wear my
      mother’s high heels, and another my grandfather’s «suit and tie». In
      fact, as a little girl I had a boyish haircut. It wasn’t my decision,
      but as a result I was sometimes mistaken for a little boy. It didn’t
      especially get to me.</p>

      <a href="#img1" id="imgref1"><img class="inside-textleft" src="assets/image/ref text/IMG_2118 2.png"></a>

    <p>There’s a funny image of my childhood. I must be 7 years old. I look
      like a tomboy. Short hair, <em>not so girly</em> jacket and I’m holding
      that plastic submachine gun. On the wall behind hang some children’s
      drawings.</p>
    <p>I still feel very close to the young girl I perceive on this picture;
      I’ve pretty much always had a rebellious spirit showing through the way
      I perform, expressed through my clothes, through the music and the
      people that turned me on.</p>
    <p>It was only later, as my girlfriends’ femininity was developing, that
      it started to bother me. It became a topic since boy were succumbing to
      the societal obsession with big breasts, which I never had. Yet I’ve
      always loved their feminity, and that of people using their <em>erotic
        power</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
    <p>I remember seeing Betty Boop’s face everywhere as a child. Maybe she
      was more of a phenomenon than now. It was exiting to find her on the
      store’s shelves. I was mesmerized by her cute face and ultra-feminine
      attitude, while the merchandise wasn’t too childish. Her image evoked
      something mature, elegant, something more like a woman than a child.</p>
    <p>It was around the same time that she enjoyed her fame as a pop icon
      online. Some of her films entered the public domain. I wasn’t using
      social media yet, but I glimpsed these animated GIFs and subliminal
      messages, with her body shape dressed up in unlimited different
      styles.</p>
    <p>Some of her devoted fans edited and covered her image over and over
      with persistence. They were becoming co-authors.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
      Online she appeared as an illicit fifth-generation bastard. In the shops
      too -- except the objects on the shelves, tagged with trademark signs,
      elevated her with an economical value.</p>
    <p>The masses craved for more intensity and glitter and transformed her
      endlessly. Till extreme. The little girl I was, sometimes loved glitter,
      sometimes hated them. But now I grasp the reason behind the love and the
      hate. I appreciate the attitude of excessive girliness because I
      understand a provocative intention that ironically resemble punk
      attitude. Refusing to be invisible. Refusing to pretend to fit the
      standards of imperial “high culture”. Loud and shameless.</p>

    <p>But let’s go back: who was she supposed to perform originally? <br>
      For her very first appearance she was designed to be a dog, the idea
      was to provide a girlfriend to Bimbo. But her look already resembling a
      lady, her creators decided she would be a human. An odd start to her
      successful future but there she is, the first woman in history of
      cartoon. Consequently, she is the only one surrounded by only male
      characters. Which means constantly targeted by the male gaze
      <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> 
        trying to seize her objectified and
      desirable body.</p>

    <p>My perception of BB differs from what I heard from most people
      considering BB a sex symbol, enticing, with a floozy outfit. While the
      scenario was only implying the sexual act, the doubt is settling and
      engender tension. Her persona is then a euphemism; the sexual act
      slightly blurred, her performance becomes erotica, «porno chic». Because
      the producers were part of the elitist industry of cinema, their image
      couldn’t be considered as <em>unwashed pornography</em>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
      That fine line is blurred by the absurdity, the metaphors, the
      ambiguity.</p>

    <p>As highlighted in Betty Boop For Ever<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>,
      the authors took great pleasure in undressing her, Betty’s image
      depended on their goodwill. Betty’s name says it all, the slangy term
      was referring to a «hot chick». The men owned her like a doll, she was
      meant to be played with.</p>

    <p>Her films have always encouraged viewers to scrutinize her luscious
      body from top to bottom. She exists to be looked at. The cinematic point
      of view forces us to experience what it is to pick out someone from the
      room<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. Laura Mulvey describes
      the
      Hollywood tendency to overvalue woman in such a way that they do no

      <img class="inside-textleft" src="assets/image/ref text/doll.png">

    <p>But her case is an exception to the rule: even if she is extremely
      objectified, she shares direct intimacy with the audience without
      intermediate body. She is the protagonist that make up the story. It can
      be empowering to identify to her. She has an illimited number of skills
      and above all, she is a boss, a great one. Betty’s ‘fathers’ endowed her
      of a stubborn temperament: she wouldn’t let herself be pushed
      around.</p>

        role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <p>In her early movies she is a very spontaneous woman who likes to have
      fun with an ounce of rascality. But at the end of the story, she depends
      on others, needs to be saved.</p>
    <p>Even if my instinct rejects the idea of a weak woman, we can also
      identify to the feeling of helplessness. Her complexity is relatable.
      The message transmitted by the Fleisher’s evoked a ‘sort of’ solidarity
      with feminists. Funnily enough, after the Hays code<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
      that censored every little ambiguity, most of Betty’s spiciness, they
      had to react<br />
      and stripped her foolishness away.</p>
    <p>As a matter of fact, she was in tune with her time: the late
      20’s<br />
      were growing times for the young white New Yorkers ladies. Betty was
      representative of the Flappers, these independent women who would allow
      themselves to party at night and drink. Who wore shorter dresses and
      haircuts. They owed their empowerment to the legacy of the
      Suffragettes.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

      <p>The Fleisher brothers, originally from Poland, grew up in the Bronx
      were innovators from a very young age. In the 20s cartoons were at a
      very early stage, most of them were very stiff. Among other technical
      aspects, the Fleisher’s were the firsts ones to modernize the industry.
      They invented the rotoscope, a tool that filmed movements frame by
      frame, so they could trace them back on paper and create smoother
      animations. In addition, to get even closer to a real experience, sound
      was added to the moving image. The use of jazz in their movies couldn’t
      be a better match. The music created perfect rhythms for the body
      movements, in harmony with the social context of the Roaring Twenties in
      the US. The combination of sound and image was avant-garde.</p>
    <p>You get the idea; these short films had every assets needed to be the
      most fashionable attraction. But let’s face it, BB was designed by a
      gang of white supremacists, from the top of their studio in Broadway. A
      powerful position to be influential.</p>

    <h1 id="a-fruit-of-appropriation">A Fruit of Appropriation</h1>
    <h2 id="part-1">Part 1</h2>
    <p>The story of Fleisher cartoons reveals a broader and well-known canon
      based on power relations. The prevalent manifestation of racism in the
      construction of contemporary western society is an undeniable factor
      that participated to modern white entertainment media.</p>
    <p>The reality of Betty Boop, the beloved cartoon, has a violent history
      that I feel the need to understand better, because I think she is
      representative of the culture I grew up in. I aim to look beyond my
      innocence. To analyze and deconstruct this inherited story. I still
      interrogate how my geopolitical construction impacts my cultural points
      of view.</p>
    <p>While I have/my culture has taken Betty for granted as a popular icon
      present everywhere, Betty is the result of a tale of the Western world,
      crossed by racial and sexual violence, but also the need for a female
      icon in film.</p>
    <p>To create a heroine and future icon loved by the people, Max Fleisher
      and his disciples had to capture the caricatural attributes of the
      booming society in which they lived.</p>
    <p>They managed to harness the most promising ideas and turn them into
      an infallible recipe for commercial entertainment. The energy of New
      York during Prohibition and the Great Depression seemed to convey an
      arduous, slightly murky but brilliant will to allow lustful revelry to
      reign eternally. Max was a precursor, playing one step ahead. «They were
      the original Bad Boys of animation.»<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
    <p>The Fleisher studio revolutionized cartooning shortly ahead Disney
      with “steamboat willie”.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
      Walt Disney and Max
      Fleischer were competitors, but their differences were glaring. Whereas
      Disney’s attitude represented the midwestern lifestyle in a rather
      cheerful way, the descendants of Polish-Jewish immigrants, who grew up
      in the Bronx and Queens, transcribed their urban environment in rough,
      realistic cartoons.</p>
    <p>The Harlem club scene propelled the careers of some of the era’s most
      renowned musicians. Glorious years for jazz and its fast-paced rhythms,
      to which the scat dancers thrilled the crowds. The reality of these
      festivities was not only exciting, it was also quite outrageous. The
      spectators at most of these clubs where jazz was thriving, well, they
      were white people who had no shortage of stereotypically racist ideas.
      But they loved to get their kicks in the underground nights, as Black
      artists entertained the gallery. «For the white public, this music was
      considered exotic, but also intuitive.»<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> I
      was confused by the presence of this music in the Fleisher’s’
      animations; when I discovered them, I believed unmindfully that they, as
      much as their peers, were being respectful of the jazz scene because
      they must have admired it and understood the essence of its transcendent
      music. Even-though I questioned this intriguing fact, my first
      impression didn’t acknowledge that they were using the obscure
      connotations of the sounds and lyrics to invoke once more the popular
      idea of a dangerous African American culture.</p>
    <p>The Fleisher’s had the audacity to be the first to incorporate these
      well-known jazz tracks into films aimed at the movie theaters, one most
      appreciated activity back then. At the time, black music was nearly
      absent from the media.</p>
    <p>Although, it was trendy among some white partygoers who were ardent
      about the underground feelings that nightclubs provided.</p>
    <p>«During the 3 first years of BB cartoon, most of the musicians
      employed were non-white.»<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
      The lyrics of the
      tunes functioned as ground to embody the script. They conducted a
      controversial message, it gave an obscure appeal to the cartoons, which
      suited the Great Depression atmosphere. The emotions were coming
      nonetheless from a place of resistance.</p>
    <p>Nothing and no one stood in Fleisher’s way. It’s the same power
      dynamics that evolved. Jazz rhythm and spirit did not belong to them,
      but they stole it, and it became the key to their success. It made their
      animations so real and endearing. I still relate to the nocturnal,
      mysterious attitude that wakes our best unconscious desires up.</p>
    <h3 id="betty-callaway">Betty &amp; Callaway</h3>
    <p>Cab Callaway sang several tunes for Betty’s episodes. The episode
      <em>Minnie the Moocher</em><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
      bears the name he gave
      to the theme song for this episode. It’s based on «Willie the Weeper», a
      vaudeville song about drug addiction.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="quote">” Oh well this is the story about Willie the Weeper</p>
      <p class="quote">Now Willie the Weeper was a chimney sweeper</p>
      <p class="quote">He had the habit, boy, he had it bad</p>
      <p class="quote">Let me tell you bout a dream he had ” <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
          role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The introduction to the episode opens with a film of the singer and
      his musicians playing the song, Cab dancing his famous Scat move. This
      cartoon is seen as one of the first videoclips.</p>
      <img class="inside-textright" src="assets/image/ref text/MinnieTheMoocher7.png">

    <p>The episode starts with young Betty sitting at the dinner table, with
      her angry dad reproaching her and her distraught mother trying to calm
      him down. Betty flees to her room to write a farewell letter before
      escaping out the window to join Bimbo the dog. They set off in long
      strides and lose themselves in supernatural, dark settings that
      transform as they go. The combination of the song’s moody atmosphere,
      illustrated by mysterious nocturnal drawings, is effective in instilling
      fear. Using this technique, the Fleisher’s label Callaway’s music, and
      perhaps the whole of Black music, as scary.</p>

    <h3 id="betty-armstrong">Betty &amp; Armstrong</h3>
    <p>Louis Armstrong sings and performs with his musicians for the episode
      <em>I’ll Be Glad When You’re Dead You Rascal You</em>,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
      in which racist mockery is further accentuated at the center of the
      narrative. Betty is captured by cannibals: «There is no room for doubt:
      these men are depicted as cannibalistic savages [...] By morphing the
      floating animated head of one of the savages chasing Bimbo and Koko
      smoothly into the filmed head of a singing Armstrong».<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
    </p>

    <img class="inside-textright" src="assets/image/ref text/0.jpg">
    <p>This cinematic trick invites the spectator to compare Louis and their
      musicians to the mobster, kidnapers and rapists that threaten Betty and
      her friends. In this way, it conveys the message that black people, and
      their ‘amusing’ music are dangerous enemies.</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>In her chapter on <em>the Myth of the Black rapist</em>, Angela Davis
      retraces history to understand how this myth was a construction made up
      by white supremacy. She explains that white supremacy needed new
      arguments for the lynching of the black community, which was becoming
      menacing for those whose goal was to oppress them.<br />
      « Rape charge turned out to be the most powerful of several attempts to
      justify the lynching of Black people. »</p>
    <p>The world of animation gravely suffered from racist stereotypes,
      which made it become a considerable tool of propaganda for
      discriminatory ideas. The charming, simplified drawings are great
      manipulators, though their lens it seems common sense who are the hero
      versus the threat.</p>
    <p>It’s so badly insane... The Fleishers - surely like most of the white
      cultural milieu of the time - could appreciate this bewitching music,
      deeply filled with heartfelt emotions, and simultaneously feel justified
      in using it to ignore the humanity of these artists.</p>
    <p>The hegemony of their social and commercial status could precisely
      have enabled them to break these sordid codes of domination. Didn’t they
      recognize the beauty of this music and the credit it deserved? Credit is
      not the only point, whatever the splendor of the music, it’s the
      neglection of the artist’s intellect. Apart from disregarding their
      humanity, they turned their music into a weapon against them.</p>

    <p>Betty was supposed to reflect a woman from that time, to make her
      stories resemble reality, so that people could recognize themselves in
      her adventures -- accompanied by her sidekicks Bimbo and Coco. In her
      case, the creators and authors of these films resorted once again to the
      art of imitation.</p>
    <p>Helen Kane sueded the studio and Paramount, their distribution
      company, for plagiarism. She proclaimed that the Betty character was
      simply a caricatural reproduction of her own performative image. Her
      facial features, her haircut and round eyes, right down to her
      distinctive attitude. The comparison is obvious. (A courageous act for a
      woman at that time.)</p>
    <p>When the cartoon was born, Helene was at the height of her success,
      so it’s inconceivable that the Fleishers weren’t influenced by her
      presence. However, Helene’s accusations have been discredited, made
      light of, and even ridiculed. Particularly when the analysis needed to
      bring the court case to a conclusion consisted of dissecting the
      differences between «Boop», «Boop Boop» or « Boop-a-Doop».</p>
    <p>One of the reasons for her defeat was — apart from the evidence that
      attacking an institution like Paramount was a risky idea — that the
      style Helene performed through her mimics, voice and appearance, was
      clearly part of a larger trend in show business at the time.</p>

      <img class="inside-textright" src="assets/image/ref text/Capture d’écran 2024-01-24 à 18.45.48.png">
    
      <p>The story goes<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> that Helene
      adapted the Scat sounds<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> to her own hits,
      after attending in 1928 a show by Esther Jones, a young dance prodigy who went on to
      international success at the extremely young age of 5... She performed
      mostly in Europe and Brazil after her first’s steps to success in USA.
      She owed her reputation in part to the comparison between her
      performance and that of the famous Florence Mills. But once she returned
      from her long tours, her fame in the USA came to an end. This gradually
      led to a total absence of information about the rest of her life. Her
      non-intentional involvement in Helene’s defeat and the unclarity makes
      the tragedy embarrassing. Little Esther may never have known about this
      affair. And in the end, she doesn’t have so much to do with the cartoon.
      What an absurdity… Justice neither gave recognition to Esther nor
      acknowledged Kane’s claim.</p>
     
    <p>The scandalous record went viral online a few years ago. It is now
      part of a long list of whitewashing denunciations. Unfortunately, like
      many of the stories circulating among social networks, it ended up being
      partially transformed into misinformation, a glitch. Some photos have
      been mistaken for Little Esther, leading to more confusion. Nonetheless,
      some dedicated individuals have managed to gather archival material to
      carry out an accurate investigation. The lawsuit was real and the
      appropriation by the Fleisher’s was obviously real.</p>

    <p>Today globally widespread, the use of cartoons born from the golden
      ages of American capitalism became symbolic, their essence is detached
      from the original context. They became graphic material used to ironical
      communicate, sometimes political messages. It’s a common-ground vessel
      that allows its user to mold it according to the role it occupies.</p>
    <p>On the Internet, the creation of social media became a place where
      borderless communities are born. Thanks to today’s means of
      communication, blogs in particular, people can join forces for a cause
      they hold dear, to pay homage by sharing their admiration.</p>

    <p>For this research I found a lot of the information on blogs such as
      bettyboop.fandom.com written by anonymous authors who generously
      committed to gather and preserve the heritage of this history. And I
      feel thankful for it.</p>
    <p>Information online isn’t (always) filtered to match the controlled
      mainstream media discourse. It is then possible to share and become
      aware of certain truths «silenced» by the policy of censorship that
      suits the power structures in place. Through digital images we tell our
      own stories, and today we can decide collectively, to a certain extent,
      on our own platforms of distribution. With a few clicks, we speculate on
      the alternatives and what they mean.</p>

    <p>With the spread of Little Esther’s story on the internet, a new
      generation of BB emerged. She resurrected once again. On a very
      different image quality than during the early GIFs era, the ai generated
      images manifest pride. I feel a much more provocative intention behind
      the participation of that image today: it has become a statement.</p>
    <p>Every time I type “Betty Boop” in the search bar of image banks, I
      see the web page displaying a group of pixelized bodies, an excessively
      feminine, overwhelming crowd of clones. Yet all singularly different.
      Like the shelves of the
      trinket shop, they stand next to each other as commodity items.</p>

      believing in power of that very group without no toxic comparison, each
      of them giving the best of themselves.</p>
      
    <p>The meaning of the old cartoon has shifted. It has not so much to do
      with the original Fleisher’s property anymore but more with the
      possibility for anyone to take part in its representation. What is left
      from the original, is precisely the need to be transformed.</p>    
    <p>Young generations no longer identify to her as the idealized cinema
      icon, we identify to the ambiguous personality. We are conditioned to
      trust in unstable representations; the confusion coming from ongoing
      renewal of blending trends is consciously translated in performative
      identities. BB reflects people but differently than she used to. Using
      her as a reference, implies to realize the impact of the society she
      comes from, a white supremacist society.</p>
      <p>I recently made <a  class="experiment" href="#mywork">experiments </a> that consisted in collecting images that
      relate to my vision of BB’s case. The visual research still in process,
      is a way for me to trigger my admiration to the topic.</p>
    <p>Next to my findings, I shared my interest to other people, and
      invited some to be participators in my collection. I presented the
      different sources are mixed up in archival sheets, piled up, because
      they are all clues to the investigation.</p>

        role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> For the youth, co-existence between
      ‘online’ and ‘irl’ is rooted in the consideration of ourselves. In the
      same way, the existence of the 100 years old Betty appears on screens as
      tangible as our selfies.</p>
    <p>Image makers, amateurs or not, guarantee the dynamic resistance of
      evolving ideas. Meanwhile, she is also a result of mass production, that
      the anonymous artists don’t benefit from. People who make money from
      branding don’t implement the power of resistance that I try to defend.
      Nevertheless, the fashionable accessories also takes part in the
      ‘renaissance’ of Betty Boop. Contradictory to the pixelized image she
      embodies, the rare commodities strived by obsesed collectors.</p>
    <p>Steyel suggests: ‘Why not affirm it?’<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
      ‘Why not be a thing?’ . I think this affirmation is a very contemporary
      feeling; accepting to be objectified by identifying to an image and
      therefore to its material aspect, to what it refers to. Behind an iconic
      image there is a person. But in Betty’s case the reference is finely
      more of an idea, a socio-political and artistic movement.</p>

    <p>I still question whether embracing the aesthetic of the <em>good

      it the only choice we have to feel important?</p>

    <p>The mediatic industry have gone a long way since the age of cinema.

        society has come from visual media and from television and videos. Just
        think, do we even know of late any powerful man of any color who's come
        out with some tirade against feminism? The tirade against feminism
        occurs so much in the image making business, in what we see. [...] what
        I'm concerned about constantly in my critical imagination is why is it

    <p>To feel more in charge, we need reassuring figures to look up to. I
      desire to continue to feel enlightened by former and new feminists to
      gain precision for the standing point I choose, to contemplate the past
      and envision what is next.</p>
